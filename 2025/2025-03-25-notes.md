# Notes

* Hybrid meeting, 11 April \- [Draft Agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VoI8wv-Rkku47JoQF8-mY1zkHeip3GSb7GED2WznklA/edit?usp=sharing)

  * Heather

    * Expecting morning to focus on FedCM / FedCM Core

    * Afternoon will focus on DC and important items there such as Issuance

  * Hicham  
    * Will be hosting the DC in Cupertino  
    * Also willing to host the WG   
  * Heather  
    * WebAuthn WG meeting is ALSO meeting at that time  
    * So, lots of interest  
  * [Tim Cappalli](mailto:Tim.Cappalli@microsoft.com)  
    * If you’re willing to host WebAuthn and DCP  
  * Hicham  
    * Not sure about WebAuthn  
    * But can host DCP and FedCM though  
  * Heather  
    * We already have space at the Google campus for those meetings  
    * (Google in Mountain View)  
    * DCP has two meetings that week — we are only interested in the one  
* Process Update  
  * Heather	  
    * Meant to have Process PRs merged — still TODO  
    * Expect update “soon”; will send update to mailing list when ready  
    * There was a formal objection on adding DC API to FedID  
    * Formal objection was overturned  
    * But still work to do, to address legitimate concerns  
    * But work can go forward  
    * Next step is to ensure members of FedID WG, not all of whom have been following DCP, know what DCP is all about  
    * Today’s meeting — Tim has a presentation (that was presented to the CCG a couple of weeks ago) on what the DCP is  
    * Generally to bring everyone up to speed before formally accepting DCP  
  * Tim Cappalli  
    * \<presentation\> [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QjTX9OLfuIY96ahMpRX7Hq6Kd6A7VyFG/view?usp=sharing)  
    * Design goals: Verifiable Credentials as a whole  
    * There are some credentials in the physical world (Real World Identity documents)  
    * For use online today, most sites just want the user to take pictures of those documents (driver’s license, passport, etc.)  
    * But now we have digital forms of those credentials  
    * But up until today they have custom schemes paired with QR codes as the way to submit  
    * mdoc://  
    * openid4vp://  
    * Etc.  
    * Not a sustainable model for the web  
    * Also, you can invoke these custom schemes from insecure context  
    * And also custom   
    * Can phish users on-device from mock selections  
    * Users are expected to know what the icons pertain to and what’s in them  
    * Users don’t know though  
    * And no standardization for custom schemes  
    * A few schemes are guaranteed to work (tel:, mailto:)   
    * But most of the new schemes are not generally known  
    * And clicking on any of these takes the user out of the browser and into another app (Google Wallet, for example) with no easy way to get back to the browser or tab they came from  
    * And users have no idea what Wallet apps are  
    * Any app can hold credentials (not just Wallets)  
    * Learning from Passkeys (year 4 of Passkeys\!)  
    * Users don’t think about holders, etc.  
    * "I’m going to Disney+.com"  
    * users don’t think about where credentials are held  
    * Users need to be able to make sane decisions about identity  
    * Also cross-device use cases abound and need to be secure and easy  
    * 4 design principles  
    * Separating the act of requesting from the protocol itself  
      * Not binding those two together  
      * So browsers and OS won’t hinder future development  
      * Big shift from WebAuthn  
      * WebAuthn — Everything is in WebAuthn and it defines the rules for everything  
      * In this case, the browser API defines the browser structure (only)  
      * Other specs define other aspects  
    * Requests need to be parsable by User Agents to allow for checks  
      * Shouldn’t include PII  
      * Should allow User agent to detect high-risk requests  
      * Allow User agents to protect users from abuse  
    * Response expected to be encrypted  
    * Prevent websites silently querying for availability of Digital Credentials  
      * Doing so would add a lot of fingerprinting experience  
      * So, like WebAuthn, you can’t just silently query for this  
    * Components  
      * DC API does not define protocols or formats  
      * Instead there’s a registry of these things  
      * Points to, for presentation: OpenID4VP  
      * OpenID4VP might then have pointers to credential formats  
      * So DC API won’t ever point  
  * Hicham  
    * OpenID for Verifiable Presentations is one of the protocols  
    * ISO also another protocol that applies to DC API (but isn’t in the registry yet — needs to be defined)  
    * Will create an issue to include the ISO standard in the DC API registry  
    * [https://github.com/ISOWG10/ISO-18013/blob/main/Working%20Documents/Working%20Draft%20WG%2010\_N2544\_18013-7%20second%20edition%20DTS%20candidate%20-%20NTC.pdf](https://github.com/ISOWG10/ISO-18013/blob/main/Working%20Documents/Working%20Draft%20WG%2010_N2544_18013-7%20second%20edition%20DTS%20candidate%20-%20NTC.pdf)  
    * Annex C specifies a mechanism to be used over the DC api that uses the request and response structure from ISO 18013-5  
    * The second edition of 18013-7 includes a protocol for the DC-API that is not based on OID4VP yes, it is called Annex C, it is based on the request and response structures used for in-person presentation defined in 18013-5  
  * Tim  
    * Roles and responsibilities  
    * 3 core arbiters in the DC flows  
    * Web Platform responsible for Permission (but explicitly NOT for Consent)  
    * Browser also provides JS API that participants call  
    * Browser provides validation  
    * Browser ensures there is a secure context (HTTPS and no Cert errors)  
    * Browser will talk to OS to contact Credential Provider (which is assumed to live at OS level)  
    * OS Platform  
      * Presents Credential chooser for presentation  
      * Presents Provider selector for issuance  
      * Responsible for Cross-device transport (similar to cross-device for Passkeys)   
      * Native app requests — in native app, want to call digital credentials API  
    * Credential Provider  
      * Will show consent screen prior to allowing a presentation to be disclosed  
      * Responsible for holder verification — biometric APIs  
      * Selective Disclosure, key management, etc.  
      * Still providing 90% of the functions here  
    * Nick Doty  
      * Surprised a bit about Consent  
      * Not sure it’s handled always by   
    * Tim  
      * No direct communication between verifier website and user  
    * Nick  
      * Shouldn’t there be a lot of communication?  
    * Tim  
      * Clear differentiation between permission and Consent  
    * Nick  
      * Perhaps it’s a terminology thing  
      * Some people say informed consent has to happen at one level  
      * But other people say that other consent happens at a different level  
    * Tim	  
      * Most verifiers are going to have a back end  
      * Verifier site calls Digital Credentials API  
      * (going over diagram — which was taken from WebAuthn with renamed roles)  
      * API is very similar (protocol and data — only two protocols)  
      * So many other pieces that are defined elsewhere, it can be confusing  
        * Who is asking?  
        * What are they asking for?  
      * If there were multiple credentials that could match, there would be a selector  
      * User could swipe through and hit “Continue”  
      * Much better than custom schemes and intent picker  
      * (demo)  
      * Demonstrating different steps of the process and how only the bare minimum amount of information is provided to necessary entities at each steps; entities are otherwise kept in the dark until need its info  
      * First demo’d on-device on phone only  
      * Then demo’d cross-devices (initiated from laptop, but DC steps are performed on the phone) — uses QR code to (initially) link the laptop with the phone  
    * Heather  
      * Wendy had an interesting question about the warning that the wallet  
      * What is the “Trust List”?  
    * Tim  
      * Each wallet is responsible for how they collect consent and determine what is trusted  
      * In EU, for example, they need to enforce strong trust  
      * So, in the demo, that provided a warning that the test  
    * Wendy  
      * That's outside the DC API — it’s in the Wallet  
    * Tim  
      * There’s not a single protocol that works in that space  
      * OpenID has a method to convey a trust list  
      * The EU will most likely be the most strict  
      * Requires all participants to register with the EU  
      * In the US it ‘s more of a free-for-all  
    * Nick  
      * We could add some trust info to the API  
      * So at the Web level, we could have info at that time on who’s verified the request, or is it on a trust list, etc.  
      * Not just whether the wallet gets the origin and tries to reverse-engineer  
    * Tim  
      * From a technical standpoint that could exist, but more of a political standpoint for how it works  
      * Currently the process is at the last step before being accepted by the WG  
      * The Issuance PR is hopefully almost done  
      * Had to write the protocol registry criteria  
      * Debates over whether, if you are a protocol added to the registry, should your specs be freely available without charge?  
      * Should the protocol registry require response encryption?  
    * Heather  
      * Questions?  
      * It has definitely progressed since last time it was presented  
      * Group can expect an email where I will kick off Call for Adoption  
      * And hopefully that will be sorted out in the next few weeks  
* FedCM: [Add single-get multi IDP support for passive mode \#686](https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM/pull/686)  
  * Nicolas  
    * Update: We merged the initial PR for supporting passive mode  
    * Will be looking at adding Active Mode Multi-IdP soon  
    * Should be relatively straightforward for the Spec  
    * But have another question  
    * Currently Chrome intends to ship the API but limit the number of IdPs you can request  
    * Reasons: Performance (the more IdPs, the slower and more network fetches you have, and FedCM is already fairly network heavy)  
    * Also Privacy Reviewers wanted to limit the number of IdPs being requested, to limit potential abuse  
    * **Thinking of initial limit of 10 IdPs** which (might be?) reasonable for most cases  
    * Except possibly Edu which could have 1000s of IdPs  
    * Maybe solve Edu with IdP registration API  
    * Then that wouldn’t be an issue, because registered IdPs are counted as one for requests  
    * So you could still support many IdPs with IdP Registration  
    * Any thoughts on this idea?  
  * Phil  
    * Is this different from old Multi-IdP support where you’d list IdPs that you’ve already signed into?  
  * Nicolas  
    * Yes, it’s the same  
  * Phil  
    * Is Single-get the accounts endpoint?  
  * Christian  
    * Nicolas is talking about the number of \`navigator.credentials.get()\` calls  
  * Phil  
    * In passive mode, you’d list the idps in the \`get()\` call, and the ones you’d logged into it would list the  
  * Nicolas  
    * Oh you mean, which IdPs it does a “fetch” from?  
    * FedCM uses the Login Status to determine which to fetch from  
    * Initial status is “Unknown”  
    * So any “Unknown” ones, it would do an initial fetch from  
    * It will not fetch from logged-out IdPs  
  * Phil  
    * For Active Mode, it was a single IdP, and that would display UI, regardless of whether user was logged into the IdP or not  
  * Heather  
    * When you said an IdP would register, do you mean register with that UA?  
  * Nicolas  
    * Yes — the user went through some sort of flow with the IdP that used the IdP Registration API  
  * Christian  
    * IdP would call \`IdentityProvider.register()\` to register the user with the UA  
  * Nicolas  
    * But that Registration API is very much still in progress  
  * Heather  
    * What are you looking for today?  Decision or Discussion?  
  * Nicolas  
    * Want consistency across browser vendors about what is supported vs. not  
    * Would be bad if Chrome only supported up to 10 IdPs, but other browsers supported more  
    * Would not be interoperable  
    * As some calls with N IdPs would work in one browser but not another  
    * So having some sort of specified limit that all browsers agree on would be good  
    * But maybe need more time to think about it  
  * Ben  
    * Need more time to think about it  
  * Nicolas  
    * Can kick off spec proposal (very short)  
    * But that can be a place where we can keep track of it  
    * And people can comment on the Spec PR  
    *   
    * Oh — realized the Multi-IdP issue was filed in the wrong place — will fix  
* FedCM: [Specify "Use another account". \#678](https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM/pull/678)  
  * Christian  
    * Another PR has an open request from Nicolas  
    * Here to get agreement from everyone  
    * This proposal proposes: Top level boolean that the IdP supports “Use Another Account” option on the UI  
    * If everyone is happy for me to merge this?  
  * Ben  
    * How to handle Nicolas’ comment?  
  * Christian  
    * Comment is a specific thing and plan to address in the way that Nicolas proposed  
  * Ben  
    * I’ll engage on the issue itself  
* FedCM: [435](https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM/issues/435)  
  * Christian:  
    * Wanted to bring attention to issue \#[435](https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM/issues/435) (Supporting Non-Email Identifiers)  
    * Would like Ben to review that provide comments  
    * It’s for supporting phone numbers and Usernames  
    * So, if Ben could do that, that would be great  
  * Heather  
    * Might pick that up in next week’s call  
* Heather  
  * Next week will be in the UK \- but co-chairs might hold the meeting next week  
* W3C Breakouts Day  
  * NOTE it’s tomorrow\!\!
