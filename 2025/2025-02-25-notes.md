# Notes

* WG Recharter  
  * Heather  
    * Main change: When there’s a consensus it’s ready, Digital Credentials API work can come here  
    * Hit a formal objection  
    * Council formed and considered  
    * Last week: Decision: Overturning objection while recognizing good points in the objection  
    * So, we need to keep in mind the points of the objection  
    * But the top-line is that when there is Consensus on Digital Credentials API, they can join this WG  
    * \<link above\>  
    * So….what does that mean for us?  
    * People who haven’t been following along with DC API need additional information to learn about it more  
    * Next week, CCG (Credentials Community Group) is having a call on "what is the Digital Credentials API?"  
    * Tim Cappelli will present  
    * Immediately following our normal call next week  
      * [https://meet.w3c-ccg.org/weekly](https://meet.w3c-ccg.org/weekly)   
    * People should put a hold on your calendars for one hour following this slot next week.  
    * Next WG call is scheduled for F2F meeting at IIW  
    * Will likely turn into joint meeting with Digital Credentials  
    * DC has a document that they want to get into First Working Draft state  
    * That will be a big topic for F2F meeting in April  
    * If / when DC API work is made a Work Item, we’ll have to change the structure of the call  
    * As not everyone working on FedCM is working on DC and vice versa  
    * So, proposal is to aim for Quarterly hybrid meetings which is the full WG and discussing full scope of WG  
    * F2F meeting will be a component of that  
    * In April there is the existing F2F meeting in MTV  
    * Potential for July in Madrid in conjunction with IETF 123  
    * November TPAC in Japan  
    * Also will have regular weekly calls  
    * DC API calls have their own cadence and will continue to use those for deep dives there  
    * Pacific calls CG calls have been held monthly  
    * But no one attends (usually)  
    * So, will be suspending those for now, until / unless a lot of interest revives  
    * All of this is in the [linked doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yR7emdjwk4BJsQWTrt06m5BTrawjlo6U-Q_ShTEpEy8/edit?tab=t.0) proposed agenda for F2F meeting in April in MTV  
    * From the google doc describing the proposed meeting schedule

—  
Given the breadth of the topics, the chairs propose the following for when the DC API work is formally accepted into the WG:

* quarterly full WG hybrid meetings  
  * April 11 in Mountain View (North America)  
  * July (exact date TBD) in conjunction with IETF 123 (Europe)  
  * November in conjunction with TPAC (Asia)  
* weekly CG/WG calls to focus on FedCM (using the existing call schedule but removing the monthly FedID WG-only call and the Pacific CG call)  
  * Remove the Pacific call from FedCM since no one shows up (but we'll re-add it if there is interest)  
* weekly WG calls to focus on the DC API (using the existing call schedule)

Meetings are open to any WG participant. Followups must always happen on the list.   
—

* Simone  
  * Due to IPR issues, rejoin the group (due to new charter)  
  * Wendy  
    * If you are not your advisory committee representative, remind the AC Rep there are things that they need to do to re-join the WG   
    * [https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/fedid/join/](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/fedid/join/)  
    * Because there is a new charter, people need to re-join the WG to make IP commitments. Otherwise, there’s a grace period after which you may lose access.  
* [Pseudonymous Credentials \#3](https://github.com/w3c-fedid/delegation/issues/3)  
  * Samuel Schlensinger  
    * Have been following FedCM from the outside  
    * IdP tracking are very serious issues  
    * Had been working on technology for this — could be repurposed to be used to help this  
    * Idea: All use-cases of Federated identity are social login  
    * Provide email address(es), name, pic  
    * Avoiding sticky identity that follows you around the web  
    * Idea is that every identity would have pseudonym that could be validated by the RP  
    * But pseudonym on one RP would not be linkable to pseudonym on a different RP  
  * Sam  
    * Did have a chance to look at technology  
    * Lots of open questions  
    * Seems like early explorational  
    * Empthasize with the problems that Sam is interested in solving  
    * We have developed technologies that allow “directed identifiers”  
    * What Sam’s proposing might be able to solve BOTH the RP tracking problem AND the IdP tracking problem  
    * Similar to progressive disclosure  
    * Lots of cases where you need your “full self”  
    * But also interesting cases where you only need to present your “smaller self”  
    * (only reveal your directed identifier and then only those aspects of your identity that are absolutely necessary for the RP)  
  * Sam S  
    * Two distinct threat models  
    * One is that you assume IdP will not collude with RPs to de-anonymize users  
    * There is no difference in account recovery  
    * But if an IdP would be able to collude with RPs, they could track  
    * Separate model where it is not possible to collude  
    * In that case, user would need to have a secret for account recovery  
  * Sam G  
    * That’s one of the open questions we’re struggling with  
    * Tension: Tri-lemma: Directed / Recoverable / Collusion Resilience  
    * Have to pick 2  
    * Sam S is taking recovery as important, but less resilient to collusion between IdPs and RPs  
    * One of the factors here is how it relates to passkeys  
    * Still try to understand that relationship  
    * If we use passkeys as recoverable / syncable identifier, might be able to relax restrictions on collusion  
    * Also: How to think about email addresses  
    * Emails are global identifiers  
    * FF and Chrome have started to run email proxy servers so that much like IP addresses to avoid having to hand out global identifiers by proxying them  
    * Important aspect of Social login  
  * Phil S  
    * Don’t understand the math completely  
    * Similar to Verifiable Credentials  
    * SD-JWTs  
    * Pairwise identifiers and global identifiers  
    * FedCM is a layer on top of that which sends things to IdP and RPs but not necessarily both (such as email address)  
  * Sam S  
    * Comes from very similar goal to Privacy Pass  
    * Trying to prove aspects of a user in an anonymous way  
    * Big overlap with VCs  
    * Should be doing due diligence with those people  
    * Difference is the pseudonym aspect  
    * Where an identifier is derived from the pseudonym  
    * Several streams of technologies seem to be converging on this  
    * Idea of authenticated pseudonym that is unlinkable between contexts  
  * Sam G  
    * Phil — know that you are familiar with SAML and it does pair-wise identifiers  
    * We call that the RP tracking problem  
    * Ability to track user across RPs  
    * That proposal solves that  
    * But doesn’t solve the IdP tracking problem  
    * SD-JWTs and MDocs can solve the IdP tracking problem  
    * Issuer no longer able to know who the RP is, but requires global identifier  
    * Which brings back the RP tracking problem  
    * What Sam is proposing solves both at the same time  
    * Keeps issuer blind to presentation but also provides different identifiers to each RP  
  * Phil  
    * In Edu, need a trust model where you know who you are issuing to  
    * But in consumer space you might not want that  
  * Sam G  
    * Yes — not expected to be useful for Edu or Enterprises  
  * Sam S  
    * THere are other applications — in terms of IOT or embedded applications where there are a lot of identifying info in configuration of hardware  
    * Could be used to log and send diagnostics without revealing identities  
    * Similar to (DAA — direct anonymous attestation) in hardware context  
  * Phil  
    * In Edu, some work on wallets where you could reveal academic credentials without revealing everything  
  * Nicolas  
    * Goals seem very tenable for many scenarios  
    * What is the key difference between existing FedCM flows with browser involvement  
    * Seems almost the same as existing FedCM  
    * Ideally the IdP would be the one doing most of the pseudonym computation?  
    * ID Assertion Endpoint would have to be blind in terms of not knowing the RP  
    * But apart from that what are the main differences?  
    * Any interests from IdPs?  
  * Sam S  
    * No, haven’t talked to any IdPs specifically about this  
  * Sam G  
    * A few IdPs have mentioned interest in this  
  * Sam S  
    * Where all the computation takes place  
    * IdP will sign a BRF Key (shared key) that the client can know and the IdP can know  
    * That key is used locally to derive pseudonym  
    * And pseudonym is has of that private key and ID of the RP  
    * Then a proof can be sent to the RP  
    * Then RP can verify that the key was signed by the IdP  
    * Proof could be done on the IdP, but want to avoid that to avoid IdP tracking.  
    * So, computation of pseudonym would be on the browser to avoid that IdP tracking  
  * Heather  
    * Definitely interest in the idea, so having it in the issues list is good  
    * Will likely come back to it as Delegation Oriented FedCM gets more interest  
  * Sam S  
    * Have some code that implements this  
    * Trying to get this into Chromium  
    * Will take a while as it is novel crypto  
    * Once that is good, will  experiment with local prototypes  
    * Will bring this up again when that happens  
* [Tracking through IDP with individualized account and client\_metadata endpoints \#700](https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM/issues/700)  
  * Nicolas  
    * Not sure if people have reviewed this  
    * Basic idea is that IdP could compute a random ID every time we get the config fetch and insert it into the path of the Accounts Endpoint and Client Metadata Endpoint  
    * That random ID wouldn’t impact those fetches  
    * But then on the subsequent fetch to the server, the IdP could discover that those two fetches come from the same user  
    * And then they could discover the RP that user is on  
    * Which effectively works around IdP tracking of users before they have agreed to letting the IdP know that info  
    * Have been brainstorming mitigations  
    * Best mitigation so far is: first time you get the config fetch, store the account endpoint that the IdP  
    * If any subsequent fetch uses a different account endpoint, reject that fetch  
    * Browsers would need to store this and the fetches would not work if the IdP is changing the fetches.  
    * Of course, if the IdP legitimately changes the endpoint URL then this would break  
    * So, not ideal in that sense  
    * Any ideas that could mitigate this better?  
    * (or questions about the attack)  
  * Phil  
    * Browser is asking the IdP for the RP’s PP and TOS (Privacy Policy and Terms of Service) — why?  
  * Nicolas  
    * Done to minimize the RPs required changes  
    * Ideally only change the IdP to support FedCM  
    * IdP \*could\* send a separate fetch from their JS library  
    * Could allow IdP to reject certain sites (if some IdPs don’t want to be associated / used on some particular sites)  
    * Key problem is really the accounts endpoint — that’s the one that has the user’s accounts (as opposed to the Client Metadata endpoint which is an uncredentialed request to the IdP)  
  * Phil  
    * Understand that first you get the cookie, then the RP ID  
    * If you got rid of the metadata endpoint that could fix it  
  * Ben  
    * Getting rid of metadata would help but not feasible  
    * Might have to mandate a UI change when we only send metadata request after an interaction with the user  
  * Yi (from chat) — Some IdPs (not all) have to validate the privacy policy and terms of service URLs for legal reasons so it cannot be fully provided by RPs for them.  
  * Phil (from chat) — Yeah, that makes sense. So maybe ignore my suggestion to remove it.  
  * Nicolas  
    * Yes — possible mitigation is to not do the accounts fetch right away  
    * But still not ideal  
    * But it’s still game over once you fetch the account  
    * Could build super-scary UI that alerts the user to let them know that once they do this the IdP will know who they are  
    * But that is essentially the same as \`requestStorageAccess()\` prompt  
    * Trying to find something that still avoids the game-over situation   
  * Ben  
    * User selects an account and then, only if they aren’t registered yet then, show Privacy Policy and Terms of Service  
  * Nicolas  
    * OIC — not fetch client metadata ahead of time  
    * … interesting  
    * That would work in the current world, as we only need to show those after the accounts  
    * Would have to think of something else that would have it in the Client Metadata  
    * Interesting  
    * Wondering how much latency that would add  
    * Currently we fetch that eagerly so that once the user selects an account we are ready to show the PP and TOS  
    * If we fetch the client metadata \*after\* the user chooses the account, that would incur additional latency before FedCM could show the PP and TOS agreement dialog to the user.

* Horizontal Reviews [https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM/issues/652](https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM/issues/652)   
  * Heather  
    * Still looking for help with Horizontal reviews \- accessibility  
    * Accessibility may suggest breaking changes if we wait too long before work with them to hear considerations – we need internal Accessibility reviewers to help coordinate  
    * So if anyone wants to learn, please sign up  
  * Phil  
    * Thanks to Nicolas and Ted, the Security and Privacy Questionnaire has tried to identify 5 questions  
    * 1 of the existing answers solves two of them  
    * Once that’s there, there are next steps, which are requesting reviews via GitHub  
    * Phil will soon-ish be getting to that  
  * Simone  
    * In general, this is a very good “Considerations” section  
* [concerns about email in Accounts List \#317](https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM/issues/317)  
  * Heather	  
    * Had discussed previously  
    * Any other things to discuss today?  
  * Sam G  
    * Christian would be best for this (but he’s not her)  
  * Heather  
    * Will leave tagged with Agenda+ so it will come back next week  
* Wiki Page: [https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM/wiki/Status-of-FPWD%E2%80%90identified-Issues](https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM/wiki/Status-of-FPWD%E2%80%90identified-Issues)   
  * Heather  
    * We have a Wiki page that keeps track of issues that require some form of resolution  
    * Which could be: we are not working on it  
    * Or we are working on it  
    * Etc.  
    * But, generally, they need some form of resolution before the first working draft.  
    * Will discuss in detail at F2F meeting  
  * Simone  
    * Change topic  
    * Question for group — do we want auto-publish?  
    * Needs to be a group issue / decision  
  * Heather  
    * This seems like something that should be in the process document  
    * Before PRs are accepted, they are reviewed  
    * Yes, we should do this  
    * Will be top of the list on next week’s call  
    * Esp. given upcoming need to expand WG scope  
  * Simone  
    * Auto-publish would be helpful; otherwise, we need to get permission before publishing each update  
    * So it could speed up publishing each update  
  * Heather  
    * Will add that that revised process document
